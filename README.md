# Dog_Catcher_Game

This game has 3 seperate implementations to it. Each implemintation builds on the previous making alterations specified in the readme. For 
example a2 builds upon a1, etc.
Each directory a1, a2, and a3 has its own seperate files and code. 
They each also have their own read me describing the code it contains.
